# LeggedKinModule

A kinematic module for legged robots which have leg-symmetry using Pinocchio &amp; IKFast.

## Usage

1. Preparation

   - Single Leg Urdf
   - CalibMat
     - Describes offset(pos&rotation&mirroring) for all legs
   - IKFast generated file
     - generated by IKFast_warpper

## TODO

- Do dichotomy search outside of IKFast_warpper
- Consider for code reusability
